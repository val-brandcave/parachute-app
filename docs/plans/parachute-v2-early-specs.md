# Parachute v2 — Early Page Specs (Draft)

> **Draft / to-discuss.** First-cut specs for the pages we haven't built yet (and
> the Technical Review rebuild). Status/route map: `parachute-v2-build-plan.md`.
>
> **Update (Jun 16 2026):** the interaction-pattern questions in these specs were
> settled in the IA session. The **decisions log in `parachute-v2-ia-map.md` is the
> source of truth**; resolved items are marked **✅ RESOLVED (decision #N)** inline
> below. These are working decisions — fine to revisit at build time if they cause
> friction, but start from them.

## Reference & principle

- **HTML reference (the POC):** `docs/references/client-html-mock/parachute-mockups.html`
  — Ed's vibe-coded proof of concept. Open it (or the per-screen notes in the processed
  meeting) when speccing. POC screen ids are cited per section below (e.g. `#screen-review`).
- **Reinterpret, don't clone.** The POC proves *what* the product does and which interactions
  users liked; it is **not** a visual or layout target — Ed himself said it's cluttered and
  "nothing is final," and Brandcave's value is the design judgment the POC lacks. For every
  screen: (1) name the POC reference, (2) analyze what works vs. what's cluttered/weak,
  (3) **suggest** our approach using current patterns, (4) leave **open questions** to settle
  with Ed/Cody. Do not lift POC markup/structure as-is.
- Each section below follows that shape; treat "Suggest" as a proposal, not a decision.

Conventions assumed throughout: atomic components, Navy & Petrol tokens, navy primary
CTAs / petrol accents, portal overlays, mock data-adapter (page → hook → store → adapter),
light/dark, density. New domain entities get added to `src/types` + `src/data/seed`.

## 1. Order a review — stepper modal (settled Jun 18 2026)

**POC ref:** `#screen-order` (the two-column "checkout": source toggle + summary rail).
**Analyze, don't clone:** the POC crams source, type, reviewer, and options onto one dense
single screen. We **reinterpret** it as the guided `StepperModal` (less at once, progressive
disclosure) **but keep the POC's "cart" mental model** as a live summary rail — the part users
liked. Built Jun 18 2026 against these decisions (`OrderModal` + `StepperModal`, global via
`useOrderStore`).

**Consolidated to THREE steps** (the POC's type/reviewer/options were each ~1 click — three
separate stepper rows felt like busywork). The summary rail makes a heavyweight Confirm step
unnecessary: the rail *graduates* into it.

Draft state shape (`store/order.store.ts`): `orderDraft { source, ycDeliveryId?, property{address,propertyType,lender,loanNo,firm}?, doc{name,pages,viaApi}?, slaDueAt?, isSecondReview, existingReviewId?, uploadParsed, reviewTypes[], assigneeId, dueDate, priority, autoReject, optionsOverridden }`.

1. **Source** — `SegmentedControl` "From YouConnect" | "Standalone upload".
   - **YouConnect:** searchable select-list of deliveries (`YcDelivery` seed — property, `loan# · type · delivered date · bank`, **NEW** / **IN QUEUE** badge). Filter inbox / search all of YC. An **IN QUEUE** pick is a **second review** → amber *"Already in your queue — continue only for an intentional second review"* note (allowed, not blocked — **decision: Allow + amber warning**).
   - **Standalone (upload-first — decision):** the dropzone is the hero; on parse, the editable property fields (address, type, lender, loan#, firm, due) **auto-fill** (AI-extracted) + a parsed file pill, in a white card. Fields are verify-and-correct, not blank entry — so both source modes converge on the same "verify the property" gesture.
   - *Next disabled until a delivery is selected or a PDF is parsed.*
2. **Configure** — one white card, three hairline-divided sections:
   - **Review type** — selectable cards, Technical and/or Administrative (≥1). Each explains its output (Technical → Reviewer Workbook; Administrative → signed attestation). Admin shows the checklist template.
   - **Reviewer & schedule** — assignee select (inherited from the YC delivery when applicable; "inherited — changeable, SLA unaffected" tag). Optional **due date** + **priority**.
   - **Org defaults** — a **direct toggle** for the auto-reject quality gate (no "Override…" disclosure); flipping it shows a *"this override applies to this order only — audited"* note.
3. **Summary** (the final step; `ORDER_STEP` key stays `confirm`) — a **two-section** review card, **one ✎ Edit per editable step** (not per field): **Appraisal** (property recap · source doc `From YouConnect — read-only / Report mismatch` · SLA/due · second-review warning → **Source**) and **Configure** (sub-grouped Review type · Reviewer & schedule · Options → **Configure**). **Run pipeline** (rocket icon) submits → creates a `review` (status `running`).
   - **✅ RESOLVED (decision #1):** "Run pipeline" (primary navy) **routes into the new review** (Technical tab, running state); "Back" stays available.

**No progressive summary rail (decision reversed Jun 18 2026).** An earlier build added a
persist-then-graduate summary rail on Source + Configure; it was dropped — with only two steps
before the Summary, a constant rail wasn't worth the width. Instead the **Summary step is the
review surface**, with per-section Edit jump-backs (above). `StepperModal` keeps its optional
`aside` slot for future wizards, but the Order flow no longer uses it.

**Optimizations baked in:** happy path = *pick → run* (YC-launched orders use `prefill`/`step`
to open pre-selected on the Summary step); upload-first AI autofill mirrors how YC deliveries
already arrive pre-filled; per-step gating (Next disabled until source chosen / ≥1 type);
duplicate detection; autofocused YC search; segmented active = navy-tint selected surface.

## 2. Technical Review — focus mode (Technical **tab** of `/reviews/[id]`)

> IA note: Technical / Administrative are **in-page tabs** on `/reviews/[id]`, and
> Findings / Builder / Workbook are **sub-views** of the Technical tab — none are
> routes, and none appear in breadcrumbs. Only `/reviews/[id]/triage` is a real sub-route.

**POC ref:** `#screen-review` (findings list + workbook rail + side PDF, 3 columns).
**Analyze, don't clone:** the POC's 3-column layout is cramped and shows every finding at
once with all actions exposed — exactly the clutter to avoid. *Suggest:* the focus-mode
below (one finding at a time, evidence docked, primary decisions only + `⋯` for the rest).
*Keep* from the POC: the accept/reject/agree/disagree model, confidence, page-cite → source,
batched send-back — those are the validated value.

Replaces the first-pass page. Core loop = decide on each finding fast, with evidence.

- **Layout:** a left **finding list/progress rail** (compact: severity dot + short label + done state) · a center **focus pane** (one finding, full width) · the cited **source page docked right** (`ai`/PDF stand-in with the excerpt highlighted). Workbook tally as a slim summary (top or collapsible right).
- **Focus pane (one finding):** category + severity chip + `ConfidenceMeter`; the finding/analysis; evidence quote with a page-cite link that drives the docked source; AI audit trail (`ai-badge` "AI-suggested", CONFIRMED/CORRECTED/FLAGGED).
- **Decision actions (always visible, navy primary):** **Agree/Accept** and **Reject** (Reject captures a reason, batched into the send-back). Secondary/tertiary behind a `⋯ ActionMenu`: Disagree & edit (override wording), Comment, Add to conditions, Flag, Open source page.
- **Navigation:** Prev/Next finding; keyboard (j/k move, a/o/r/c act, ↵); jump from the list rail. Sort by severity / page; filter by severity.
- **Pipeline states:** empty (not ordered), running (staged S1–S5 with shimmer), content.
- **Send back to appraiser:** batches all rejected/condition findings into a return letter; sets status `returned`; SLA keeps running. (Appraisers want mistakes batched, not one-by-one.)
- **Workbook tally:** Accepted / Overridden / Rejected / Pending → "Compile workbook" (to Workbook) and "Return to appraiser".
- **Add finding / bulk accept — ✅ RESOLVED (decision #3):** "Add finding" opens a **right side-drawer** form (reuses the quick-look drawer pattern); "Accept all passes" is a secondary toolbar button. "Add" is primary navy in the drawer.
- **Quick-look from the queue — ✅ RESOLVED (decision #2):** the `/reviews` queue gets a **right side-drawer quick-look** (status, findings summary, next action, download); "Open review" enters this workspace. (Lives on the Reviews queue, but shares the drawer used above.)
- *Still open (build-time detail, not an IA call):* exact 2- vs 3-pane behavior on narrow widths; whether the list rail and source can both show at once.

---

## 3. Administrative Review (Administrative **tab** of `/reviews/[id]`)

**POC ref:** `#screen-adminreview` (attestation cards + side PDF).
**Analyze, don't clone:** reuse the attestation idea but apply our finding/card patterns and
the `⋯`/primary-action hierarchy for consistency with Technical Review.
**✅ RESOLVED (decision #4):** Administrative **shares the Technical focus-mode shell**
(list rail + focus pane + docked source), with attestation content instead of findings —
one workspace UI, not two.

AI-prefilled compliance checklist the reviewer attests to.

- **Header band:** Technical / Administrative are sibling tabs (already in `ReviewContextBar`); coverage summary (X of N attested).
- **Attestation list** (grouped by checklist section): each item = question · AI-suggested **Yes/No/NA** + `ConfidenceMeter` + page cite + evidence quote. Reviewer sets Yes/No/NA; **changing the AI answer requires an audited reason note**. "Confirm routine answers" bulk-confirms unchanged items.
- **Sign:** preview the signed attestation doc → sign (name/timestamp/hash) → export. DRAFT until signed.
- Data: `checklistItems` per review (seeded); checklist template from Settings/Templates.

---

## 4. Workbook (Workbook **sub-view** of the Technical tab)

**POC ref:** `#screen-workbook` (compiled doc) + the customize panel.
**Analyze, don't clone:** the POC mixes document preview and a long settings list. *Suggest:*
keep the document clean and move customization into the Builder / a focused side panel; surface
only the lifecycle actions (sign / complete / return) on the Workbook itself.
**✅ RESOLVED (decision #5):** the **Builder owns all customization**; the Workbook is the
clean compiled doc + lifecycle (Sign → Complete / Return) only — no customization controls on it.

The compiled, branded, auditor-facing output — the v2 "make it my work" surface.

- **Compiled document** rendered from `SECTIONS` + finding dispositions + `docSettings`. DRAFT watermark until signed.
- **Lifecycle:** Sign (signature block: name, timestamp, SHA-256) → **Complete** (filed) OR **Return to appraiser** (drafts return letter from Conditions). 
- **Customize** (lives in the **Builder** — decision #5): show/hide rejected & overridden, show/hide status & confidence, color-coding on/off, **theme**, **font**, **font size**, **risk rating** (custom labels/colors/wording), header/footer + logo. Org-level brand defaults vs per-workbook overrides — *still open (build-time detail).*
- **Conditions of Approval / Action items** auto-aggregated from findings whose response is "requires revision" / "concur with condition".
- **Exhibits** the doc renderer supports: tables, bar charts, cap-rate range plot, SWOT, heat-shaded sensitivity (from POC).
- Download menu: PDF / DOCX / ZIP, DRAFT vs FINAL.

---

## 5. Builder (Builder **sub-view** of the Technical tab; org mode via Templates)

**POC ref:** `#screen-builder` (3-pane: section list · editor · template library / live preview).
**Analyze, don't clone:** the 3-pane concept is sound but POC-dense. *Suggest:* keep the
three zones but apply our spacing/atoms, and reuse `StepperModal`/panels where a full builder
is overkill. **✅ RESOLVED (decision #6):** v2 ships a **focused customize panel**
(reorder/exclude sections, show-hide, theme, font, risk labels) that **owns all customization**;
the full 3-pane builder + appraisal-section import + org section-library publish are **deferred**.

Assemble/configure the workbook layout. Two modes: **per-review** and **org default** (versioned).

- **3-pane:** section list (drag-reorder, exclude/include, add/delete) · section editor (per type: categories, exhibits, sensitivity, SWOT, actions, free text, certification, or Document Settings) · template library / **live mini-preview** of the compiled doc.
- **Import band:** drag appraisal sections (Highest & Best Use, subject paragraphs, etc.) into the layout.
- **Document Settings** (pinned): the customization listed under Workbook above.
- **Merge fields:** `{{property}} {{page}} {{topic}} {{action}} {{condition}} {{detail}}` — auto-filled or bracket placeholders.
- Org mode: Section Library + "Publish org default vN".
- *Note:* this is the deepest surface. **For v2, build only the customize panel (decision #6)**; treat the full 3-pane / import / org-publish as a later phase. (The 3-pane details above describe that eventual full builder.)

---

## 6. Templates hub (`/templates`) — **focus area**

**POC ref:** `#screen-templates` (4 tiles) → `#screen-tplchecklist` (checklist mapper),
`#screen-tplresponses` (response templates), Org Workbook Layout (= Builder org mode).
**Analyze, don't clone:** the POC tile hub is fine as a concept; *suggest* deciding hub
shape against our patterns (cards vs. left-nav vs. tabs) and resolving the
Settings-vs-Templates overlap for checklist management before building.

Hub linking the three template tools. Under our patterns, a `/templates` landing with
cards, each opening a sub-route or panel.

- **Checklist Template Mapper** — upload the bank's checklist `.docx`; AI extracts items; each mapped/flagged (BINARY vs QUALITATIVE; flags ambiguous/double-barreled rows); re-extract; publish new version. This is what drives Administrative Review.
- **Response Templates** — org library + personal: Concur / Concur w/ observation / Concur subject to condition / Requires revision / Reviewer override / Not applicable / Free text. Editor with merge-field chips + live preview. These populate the finding `ActionMenu` and workbook responses.
- **Org Workbook Layout** — = Builder in org-default mode (section library, versioned publish).
- **✅ RESOLVED (decision #7):** the hub is **cards → sub-routes**; the **Checklist Mapper's home is Templates** (Settings → Compliance links to it); the Response-template editor is **master/detail within its sub-route**.

---

## 7. Intake Triage (`/reviews/[id]/triage`) — restyle

**POC ref:** `#screen-triage`. **Analyze, don't clone:** logic is fine; just bring the
existing first-pass page onto current patterns (`.pagehead`/atoms).
**✅ RESOLVED (decision #8):** triage **stays its own route** `/reviews/[id]/triage`
(the only routed review sub-page), linked from the Dashboard "Intake triage" tile.
CTA: "Override & admit" primary navy (audited); "Confirm & return" secondary outline.

Functional, needs current-pattern restyle. Auto-rejected appraisal: failed-criterion card +
evidence; "Your call" → Confirm & return to appraiser, or Override & admit (audited reason →
starts pipeline). SLA paused while in triage.

---

## 8. Settings — deepen partial sections

**POC ref:** `#screen-appsettings` (org name, default review profile, reviewer profile +
signature, org defaults: auto-reject criteria, SLA start, default admin checklist).
**Analyze, don't clone:** the POC is a single flat list; we already **reinterpreted** it into
the tabbed Settings (Organization · Review defaults · Compliance · My profile · Preferences) +
added theme/density. Remaining work is depth, not layout.

Built tabbed; make the display-only parts real (pending the API layer):
- **Compliance:** wire checklist "Manage" (→ Templates mapper) and bank-policy upload flow.
- **Review defaults / Organization / Profile:** persist via the adapter when available.
- *Preferences (theme + density) already live.*

---

## 9. Reviews queue (`/reviews`) — IA & column patterns (settled Jun 2026)

**POC ref:** `#screen-dashboard` review-list (the 7-column team queue) + `REVIEWS[]` data.
Built first-pass as a thin table; **rebuilt** in this session against the POC + meeting IA.

**Persona / org model (resolved):** the user is a **reviewer / chief appraiser in a
bank's appraisal-review department** (Ed: *"think about this being an office or
department… separate the different stages"*). The queue is a **team view**. Model =
**single bank, multi-branch**: the **org *is* the bank** (org card / header context,
**not** a row column). The three things that vary per row are:
- **Reviewer (teammate)** — why you see others' reviews; the team owns the queue. ("Mine only" narrows to you.)
- **Appraisal firm (fee appraiser)** — the external vendor whose work is under review; the **send-back target**. First-class party (`Review.appraisalFirm`).
- **Loan / property / program** — the lending entity each appraisal serves (the varying "bank" names in the POC are branches/programs, not separate customers).

**State is derived, never a synthetic status.** The cooked-up `needs_action`/`in_review`
statuses are gone. `ReviewStatus` = honest phases (`intake · autorejected · running ·
in_review · returned · completed`). A row's state reads from **Pipeline + Findings + Type**
together — there is **no Status column**. All derivation lives in `lib/review-lifecycle.ts`:
- `pipelineView` → the **Pipeline column = the phase carrier**: S1–S5 dots (done/active/idle) for in/post-pipeline, or a **word-state badge** (revised Jun 18 2026): pre-order intake = **`New`** / **`New from YC`** (YouConnect glyph when `source==="yc"`) info-pill; auto-rejected = red **`Auto Rejected`** pill; in_review = `Ready`; completed = **`Completed`** (hover card adds a "Reviewed and signed by {reviewer}" footnote). (`returned`→`Returned · rev 2` is dormant — see Q1.)
- `outcomeView` → **Findings**: worst-severity chip + count (`1 critical` / `5 fail` / `2 flagged` / `clean`); `—` before the pipeline produces findings (needs `Review.worstSeverity`).
- `nextActionView` → **one derived primary per row** (`Run`→Order stepper pre-selected on its Confirm & run step · `Triage` · `Review →` · `Sign attestation` · `Compile` · `Download`). **Quiet waits render nothing** (revised Jun 18 2026): `Running…` / `With appraiser` are dropped — those rows show only the `⋯` menu.
- `lifecycleBucket` / `needsMyAction` / `isOverdue` → drive tabs + sort + the dashboard's Action-needed.

**Columns (aligned grid, desktop-first — column set revised Jun 18 2026):**
`Property` (address / `appraisalFirm · loan# · propertyType`) · `Reviewer` (its **own
narrow, avatar-only column** — `Avatar` + name on hover; pulled OUT of Property) · `Type`
(TECH/ADMIN **chips** — spaced pills, can be both; `— at order` pre-order) · `Pipeline`
(`PipelineTracker` molecule — see below) · `Findings` · `Due` (a **neutral date** + a trailing
**urgency marker** — amber clock = due-soon, red triangle = overdue — whose tooltip carries
the magnitude `Due in Nd`/`Overdue Nd`; on-track = date only; **completed shows its date with
NO marker**; `—` for auto-rejected (SLA paused)) · `Actions` (**one merged right-aligned cell**: the derived
primary action + `⋯` `ActionMenu` (Open · Triage · Download) — the old "Next action"
header is dropped as redundant). **Risk is NOT a queue column** (it's a workbook/finding
concept). Row click → review; the Actions cell stops propagation.

**Pipeline = an animated journey tracker** ("the parachute working its magic"): segmented
track of S1–S5 where done segments fill, the **active segment is a static half-fill**
(petrol→tint; the single petrol "AI working" cue is the badge's pulsing dot above the
track), upcoming segments stay idle; the **live stage name shows inline** and a hover
tooltip lists all five stages with their state. Pre/post-pipeline phases render a **word-state
badge** (revised Jun 18 2026): `New` / `New from YC` (intake) · `Auto Rejected` (red pill) ·
`Ready` (in_review) · `Completed` (with a "Reviewed and signed by {reviewer}" hover footnote). Dot-states render the label as a **pill badge stacked on top** of the track (ready/completed = green, running = petrol w/ pulsing dot). (`Returned
· rev 2` is dormant pending Q1.)

**Tabs = lifecycle stages** (Ed's "separate the stages"), **not** scope (revised Jun 18 2026):
`All · Needs action · In pipeline · Intake · Completed`. **Auto-rejected folds into Needs
action** (`lifecycleBucket: autorejected → needs_action`) — it needs the reviewer to triage;
Intake = plain `intake` (awaiting order) only. The **`Sent back` (returned) tab + example are
removed pending client Q1** (`parachute-v2-client-questions.md`); the code is left dormant. **All scope filters are encapsulated in one `Filters` popover**
(`QueueFilters` molecule — portal, staged draft, Apply/Clear) with **five facets that are ALL
the same multi-select dropdown** (`MultiSelect`): **Findings (severity color cues on rows +
tinted trigger) · Type · Reviewer (avatar + name, "You" tag) · Appraisal firm (text-only) ·
Due (Overdue/Due soon/SLA paused)**, plus a removable **active-filter chip** strip (one chip
per selected value). **Every facet uses the same tri-state select-all** model (`MultiSel =
"all" | string[]`): the **"All" row is a plain toggle** (select-all `"all"` ↔ deselect-all
`[]`); `"all"` is the default (no filter, every row checked, **no chip** — thumb rule:
all-selected = default); a subset filters to those (master indeterminate `–`, a full
selection collapses back to `"all"`); and `[]` = none (matches nothing → a removable "No …"
chip). Isolate one = click All to clear, then check it. **Mine** = checking your own name (no
separate toggle); **Flagged / "severity" is gone** — the honest **Findings** facet
(`findingsKey()`). Filter state: `findings · types · reviewers · firms · due`, each a
`MultiSel`. Toolbar packs tabs + search + Filters + Order CTA on one line.
Sort: needs-me → overdue → running → due asc.

**Data/identity added:** `Review.appraisalFirm`, `Review.worstSeverity`; a real **team**
(`users.seed` + `users.store`); `CURRENT_USER.id = user-001` so "Mine only" resolves.

---

## 10. Run flow — confirm gate (`RunConfirm`) — D2 (settled Jun 30 2026)

**What this is:** the pre-review "fast confirm" in the J3/J1 run flow (`components/run/RunConfirm.tsx`),
shown after upload/YC-delivery and before `progress`. Source brief: `parachute-update-plan.md`
+ the Jun 30 call (`meetings/processed-calls/parachute-jun-30-2026-processed.md`, decision **D2**).

**Why it changed:** today the gate is **fields-first, type-last** — review type sits at the
bottom and drives nothing. Cody (repeat from the prior call): *"you have to select the review
type first in order to know the inputs… those inputs are dependent on the review type."* Not all
future review types are property-based, so the form must be **schema-driven by review type.**
This is **distinct from §1 Order/Configure**: that's the heavyweight order wizard; this is the
lean in-flow confirm. Keep them consistent in language, not identical in scope.

**Resolved layout (settled Jun 30 — MCQs w/ Val, then simplified on visual review):**
**single adaptive card**, type-first, **name-only pills**.

```

1. **Type picker — name-only pills (revised Jun 30 on visual review).** A wrapping row of
   **`.run-cf-pill`** chips — **just the labels**, no icons, no descriptions, no output text.
   Multi-select per **D3** (one PDF, ≥1 type).
   - **Live pills** — `Technical` and `Administrative`. Selected = navy `--md-selected` fill
     (no check icon — fill *is* the affordance). **Technical stays locked-on for MVP**
     (`locked`+`defaultOn`); Administrative toggles.
   - **Coming-soon pills** — kept to a short tail of **2**: `Evaluation (coming soon)` and
     `Vendor short form (coming soon)`. Muted + dashed, `aria-disabled`, non-interactive — name
     plus a parenthetical "(coming soon)" only. (The earlier 5-card icon grid was dropped: too
     heavy, and it read as broken.)
2. **Selection display — 2 layers (decision).** Pill on-state (fill) **+** the per-type setup
   section that fades in below (`AnimatePresence` height/opacity). **No footer echo, no chips.**
   A selected type "earns" its setup section — selection and consequence are the same gesture.
3. **Field scope — lean (decision).** The gate collects identity + type + template **only**;
   assignee · due date · priority · auto-reject stay in §1 Order / post-run config.

| Field group | Fields | Shown for |
|---|---|---|
| `identity` (shared, rendered once) | Address* · Property type · Client/Lender · Loan # · Appraiser firm | any **property-based** type |
| `technical` | Technical checklist/template (defaults to org-default `ChecklistTemplate.isDefault`) | Technical |
| `administrative` | Compliance checklist (org-default) · Bank policy doc *(optional upload — the fine-tuning context banks supply)* | Administrative |

- `Property type` lives in `identity` but is **load-bearing for Technical** (drives the rule
  set / classification pass) — keep it prominent.
- Checklist defaults mirror §1 and Templates (single source of truth); an explicit pick is a
  per-order override (audited), same rule as the Order flow.

**Generic registry (decision: build now, 2 active).** Decouples the UI from exactly-two types
without resolving property-vs-entity (still Ed's call — `parachute-v2-client-questions.md` Q3).
```ts
interface ReviewTypeSpec {
  id: ReviewTypeId;            // technical | administrative | evaluation | vendor_short
                              //  | property_type_tech | environmental | residential
  label; desc; output; icon;
  status: "live" | "soon";
  propertyBased: boolean;      // future env/vendor types → false ⇒ omit the `identity` group
  locked?: boolean;            // technical (MVP)
  defaultOn?: boolean;         // technical
  fieldGroups: ("identity" | "technical" | "administrative")[];
}
```
The form renders the **union** of `fieldGroups` across selected **live** types, deduping
`identity`. A future non-property type (`propertyBased:false`, no `identity` group) is the
forcing function for Ed's property-vs-entity decision — **Environmental** (site/report-centric)
and **Vendor short form** (appraiser-centric) are the two that genuinely strain the
property-centric model.

**Other review types — context for Ed/Cody.** MVP = Technical + Administrative only (confirmed
Jun 23). The picker names just **2** roadmap types as "(coming soon)" — `Evaluation` and the
fee-appraiser `Vendor short form` (pass/fail "thumbs", a cheaper PLG entry). The wider roadmap
from Ed's Jun 23 riff (31:11–35:00) — property-type-specific technical forms, residential,
environmental — stays in `RunReviewType`'s id-space for forward-compat but is **not surfaced**
in the picker until greenlit (avoids crowding the fast gate).

**Implementation touch-points:** `RunConfirm.tsx` (reorder + registry-driven sections);
`onStart` / `run.store` extended to carry the chosen checklist ids (today it passes only
`display` + `types`). Keep `RunReviewType` but widen to the registry ids.

**Open (not blocking the build):** exact field set for the 5 soon types (deferred until any is
greenlit); whether `property_type_tech` is a standalone type or a Technical variant.

## Cross-cutting / to add to the data model

New seed/types as these land: `ycEngagements`, `checklistItems`, `checklistTemplates`,
`responseTemplates`, `workbookSections`/`layouts`, `docSettings`, `policies`, `auditEvents`,
`orgDefaults`. Keep the adapter contract so the eng team can swap real APIs.
